## DMCA Takedowns

There are some books in this repo. If you are from a publishing house or the auther of a book and would like you book took down from the repo, do the civilized thing and send me an email at ian.flores@mailfence.com with your DMCA notice for takedown. We suggest this process instead of taking the whole repo down with a DMCA notice as we believe in open and free knowledge and wouldn't like the rest of the project to be affected for one resource.
